# My LeetCode Journey

## About This Repository

Welcome! This repository is an automated collection of my solutions to problems on LeetCode.

The code for each problem is added to this repository automatically using the [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync) browser extension immediately after a successful submission on the LeetCode platform. This process ensures that my progress is logged in real-time without any manual intervention.

## My Motivation

The main goal of this public log is to track my journey in mastering data structures and algorithms, practice writing clean and efficient code, and build a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals for my career as a software developer.

## Navigating the Solutions

Since this repository is populated automatically, the best way to browse my solutions is by using GitHub's native file and folder navigation.

The `LeetSync` extension organizes each problem into its own directory, which is usually named with the problem's corresponding number and title (e.g., `[1] Two Sum`). Inside each directory, you will typically find:

* **A solution file** (e.g., `solution.js`, `solution.py`, etc.) containing my accepted code.
* **A `README.md` file** with a copy of the original problem description, examples, and constraints from LeetCode.

This structure makes it easy to see both the problem and its solution in one place.
